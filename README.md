### Product Mission Statement:

Our project aims to create a simple yet practical Flutter.io application, leveraging the powerful features of the Google Maps API. Our primary objective is to provide users with a convenient way to discover nearby restaurants and enable them to create a persistent favorites list, allowing them to store their most beloved dining establishments in a separate view. Through this application, we aim to offer users a seamless way to explore nearby restaurants and efficiently manage their personal collections to meet and promptly address their culinary cravings.


### Product User Stories:

1.As a restaurant enthusiast, I wish to be able to use the application to search for and browse restaurants near me, enabling me to stay informed about my dining options at all times.

2.As a foodie, I want to be able to search for specific types of restaurants within the application, such as Italian restaurants or vegetarian eateries, to cater to my tastes.

3.As a user, I hope to be able to add my favorite restaurants to my personal favorites list, allowing for easy access in the future.

4.As a user, I want to be able to view the list of restaurants in my favorites and remove those that no longer pique my interest.

5.As a new user, I hope that the application features a user-friendly interface and straightforward navigation, allowing me to quickly get started with it.

6.As a user, I wish to see detailed information about each restaurant, such as its address, ratings, and reviews, to make the wisest dining choices.



### Development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

1.Utilize the Google Maps Places API to search for nearby restaurants.

2.Allow users to browse a list of restaurants and view basic information for each establishment.

3.Enable users to add their favorite restaurants to a favorites list.

4.Permit users to view and manage their preferred restaurants within their personal favorites list.

### Using Third-Party APIs to Demonstrate User Stories:

We will utilize the Google Maps Places API as a third-party API to implement the key functionalities outlined in the user stories, including finding nearby restaurants, retrieving detailed restaurant information and ratings, and adding restaurants to the favorites list. By integrating these APIs, we will provide users with a powerful tool to make it easier for them to discover and manage their restaurant choices. This will ensure that our application delivers the best user experience and caters to users' culinary needs.
